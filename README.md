## Welcome to PV-Calculator project

This is a CLI application that was made for y personal use in my work as an renewable energy engineer. 
It's purpose is to create basic materials lists for a photovoltaic installation based on the required input data. 
It creates both electric and construction materials lists, and exports list to the excel file.

This application is made for standard installations up to 60 kWp. All the formulas are based on good engineering practice.
If there are some special requirements you should take note, to consider any specific installation requirements.

## Features

- creating list of basic electrical materials for PV installation like cables, electrical breakers, inverters, switchboard and else.
- creating list of basic construction materials for different installation types on flat roof or sloping roof
- save the list to the excel file to the location of your choice

## How to run
